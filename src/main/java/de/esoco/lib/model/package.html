<p>The model package contains a set of interfaces and some base implementations 
of these that define simple data structures based on the 
{@link de.esoco.lib.model.DataModel} interface. A data model is a iterable 
structure that provides indexed access to it's data elements.</p>
<p>All classes in this package are safe for use in a limited Java environment 
like the Javascript translation of GWT.</p>
