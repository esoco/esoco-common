/**
 * An extended data model interface that is optimized for remote access. Because
 * the communication with remote systems can be affected by delays or
 * interruptions a remote data model provides additional methods to support
 * asynchronous communication. This allows the calling code to continue with
 * other tasks like UI updates without being blocked by the data model query.
 * This is achieved by providing a window into the remote data that can be
 * accessed through the methods of this interface. This window typically only
 * contains a subset of the full data in the remote model.
 *
 * <p>The method {@link #setWindow(int, int, Callback)} must be invoked to
 * request remote data. The callback given to this method will be called as soon
 * as the data has been retrieved from the remote system. Only the requested
 * range of data can then be read from the model. Therefore application code
 * must always prepare the model data before accessing it. Furthermore iterators
 * returned by a remote model only iterate over the prepared data of the
 * model.</p>
 *
 * <p>The result of the method {@link #getElementCount()} should only be
 * expected to be available after the model window has been prepared once.
 * Depending on the model implementation the element count may only be an
 * estimation. For example, if the remote data is based on a database query the
 * amount of data available may change during subsequent model accesses.
 * Therefore an application must not rely on this value and consequently also
 * not on the expected number of prepared data records. Instead it must
 * explicitly check the actual amount of records that have been prepared by the
 * last call to the method {@link #setWindow(int, int, Callback)}, either by
 * invoking {@link #getAvailableElementCount()} or by iterating through the
 * model. The actual number of prepared records may even be 0, e.g. if data has
 * been deleted on the remote side.</p>
